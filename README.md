### **Executive Summary**  

This report provides a detailed analysis of nursing staffing patterns and patient census trends to support informed decision-making for the sales team. Key findings and actionable insights include:  

1. **Patient Census Trends:**  
   - The highest recorded patient census (MDScensus) is **743** at *The Plaza Rehab and Nursing Center*, with NY State leading nationally with an average of **163.4 residents per facility**.  
   - March 2024 saw peak activity, with **37,903,405 total residents** and the highest nurse hours logged, highlighting seasonal spikes in demand.  

2. **Staffing Insights:**  
   - A positive correlation exists between patient census and nursing hours, where facilities with more residents require significantly higher nursing hours. However, certain roles (Directors of Nursing, Nurse Aides in Training, and Med Aides/Technicians) show minimal variation regardless of census size.  
   - Employee nurses work **27,116 hours on average**, far exceeding contract nurses at **2,282 hours**.
   - Facilities like *Highland Park Care Center* in Texas heavily rely on contract workers, with **17.9 average hours per day**.  

3. **Provider and Staffing Patterns:**  
   - The five providers with the highest patient census and nursing hours are concentrated in NY State.  
   - RNs, LPNs, and CNAs are the primary contributors to nursing hours, while Nurse Aides in Training and Med Aides/Technicians contribute negligible hours, even at major facilities.  

4. **Underutilized Facilities:**  
   - There are **112 providers** with zero recorded patients daily, compared to **11,469 providers** with over 50 patients daily. This presents opportunities for engagement with underperforming facilities.  

5. **Patient Ratios:**  
   - LPN-to-patient ratios are notably higher than RN-to-patient ratios, suggesting a heavier reliance on LPNs for direct care.  

### **Recommendations:**  
- **Target High-Census States:** Focus on NY and similar high-demand regions to tailor staffing solutions and campaigns.  
- **Capitalize on Peak Demand:** March trends suggest opportunities for strategic sales alignment during seasonal spikes.  
- **Optimize Workforce Dynamics:** Highlight employee productivity while offering solutions to improve contract nurse efficiency.  
- **Engage Underperforming Providers:** Address barriers for facilities with low or zero census to unlock growth opportunities.  

This analysis equips the sales team with actionable insights to enhance strategic planning, optimize resource allocation, and strengthen client relationships.
